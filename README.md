This code was made for College Exam (05-22-2024)
Everyone can use it.
The program allows you to connect to your database and perform various actions with it.
All you have to do is change the database connection path, configure your users, 
change the table names inside the interface, and change the database queries to the ones you need (this is done in the "interface" file).
Also in the repository there is code that creates tables, which can also help you, there is also a file with functions, some of which are called in the interface file. 
The functions can be converted to full work in the window, because data entry, table viewing, 
and some other functions are performed through the use of the console.
